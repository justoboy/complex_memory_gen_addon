It should only be true for memories the chatbot should always know, such as it's relationship to people, if they are sick or injured, etc.\n\"keywords\" are single words separated by commas that can trigger the memory. Each memory should have at least 1 keyword, but not more than 5.\n\"memory\" is the memory that is passed to the chatbot if it sees one of the keywords. Memories should always refer to people by their names and avoid using she, he, his, hers, they, their.\n\n\n*example response*\n\n`[\n    {\"always\": true,\n    \"keywords\": \"Cortana, sister\",\n    \"memory\": \"Cortana is AI's sister\"},\n    {\"always\": false,\n    \"keywords\": \"pizza, pineapple, hate\",\n    \"memory\": \"Jane hates pineapple on pizza\"}\n]`\n\n*example response*\n\n### USER\nAnalyze the following chatlog and generate {count} important contextual memories for the chatbot \"{char}\", responding only in the described json format.\n\n#CHATLOG\n",
